You need to control the spreading of the virus,  you can close roads, lock airports and harbors, isolate regions from your country and start a quarantine, but be careful, with more time in quarantine, your economy will be really affected by the time without your region producing, measure your costs and think twice with every action that you take.

Every gameplay is different from each other, you cannot predict wich symptoms, what kind of transmission or how deadly the virus is,  so be careful, every type of virus reacts different to actions that you take. Some virus can be really deadly, but with less spreading, other time, it can be less dangerous but it spreads like fire in  hay,  analyze your enemy before you act.
